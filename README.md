## Datasets

Currently we're working with:

* [WHU-TLS](https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/WHU-TLS)

* [3dLoMatch](https://3dmatch.cs.princeton.edu/)

The script `get_datasets.sh` downloads the files to the `data` folder, except for those stored in google drive, it was
too much of a pain to setup, so you'll have to manually download it.
