## Pretrained Models

We provide our pretrained models and training log for both ScanNet and SUN RGB-D here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XX72FsbI56_vMBax7BZSiGVFuCOPffHC?usp=sharing).

### Evaluation

We evaluate our pre-trained models on [VoteNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09664).

We add our fine-tuning code to the original VoteNet codebase. Please checkout this [repo](https://github.com/SimingYan/votenet) for more details.
